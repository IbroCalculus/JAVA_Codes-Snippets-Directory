
Abstract keyword adds a layer of security to a program. This can be applied to both classes and methods with the abstract class.
Abstract class can not be instantiated, but they can have a subclass
Abstract methods are declared without an implementation.


Assume a parent class Vehicle which is abstract, and a subclass Car. We cannot instantiate the abstract class. i.e: Vehicle

public abstract class Vehicle {

}

public class Car extends Vehicle{
    
}

--- Inside main method ----------

    public static void main(String[] args) {

	Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle ();	<--- This generates an error, because it is abstract, hence, cannot be instantiated.
        Car car = new Car();

    }
}


==================== ABSTRACT METHODS =================
Declared within an abstract class. It can not contain a body. ie {}. And the inherited abstract method must be implemented in the child class.

public abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void move();
}


public class Car extends Vehicle{

    @Override
    void move() {
        System.out.println("The car is moving");
    }
}
